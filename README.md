# Exploratory-Analysis
Exploratory Analysis of Treatment of Solid Waste in China.

Songs from Omnipotent Youth Society incorporate elements of Hebei's industrial industry, reflecting the structural challenges in the region's development. Therefore, I began to wonder about the generation and utilization of (industrial) waste in different regions of China. Are there significant regional differences in this regard?

The first file Single_Index_Analysis.ipynb was finished in the Python programming design course in the Spring 2022. The first attempt was only related to one index and 3 years, which was limited to showing comprehensive situation. 

This year, I used the entire panel data regarding this, and applied two methods - feature extraction and Tucker3 decomposition to panel data for cluster analysis, in order to demonstrate the imbalanced state of solid waste treatment in different regions. I didn't mean to compare the methods, but to display how subjective knowledge could affect the analytical result. Apart from that, it was my rough trial towards meta-analysis, using the two most popular programming languages in Data Science on Jupyter Notebook. 

The reading order of the four Jupyter Notebook files should be like this:
Firtly, Single_Index_Analysis.ipynb.
Secondly, Panel_Data_Analysis-Feature Extraction
Thirdly, Panel_Data_Analysis-Tucker3 Decomposition
Finally, Panel_Data_Analysis-Tucker3 Decompotision-Python
